# hugo-theme

A simple Hugo theme used in my [personal website](https://github.com/LiquidPL/website).

## Requirements

* Hugo 0.87.0 or higher (will most likely work on older versions as well, but I haven't tested those)
* Dart Sass with [dart-sass-embedded](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass-embedded) in `PATH`
* A recent version of Node.js and NPM
